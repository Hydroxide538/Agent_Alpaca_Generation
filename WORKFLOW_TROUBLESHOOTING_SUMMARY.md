# Workflow Troubleshooting Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Workflow Not Actually Executing CrewAI Tasks**
**Problem**: The workflow manager was only simulating the CrewAI execution with `await asyncio.sleep(2)` instead of actually running the crew.

**Solution**: Modified `backend/workflow_manager.py` to actually execute the CrewAI workflow using `crew_instance.crew().kickoff(inputs=inputs)` in a thread executor to avoid blocking the async workflow.

### 2. **Hardcoded Model References**
**Problem**: The test file `test_ollama_workflow.py` had hardcoded references to `llama2` which doesn't exist in your system.

**Solution**: Updated the test to dynamically detect and select available models from your Ollama instance:
- Data Generation: `mistral-small3.2:latest`
- Embedding: `snowflake-arctic-embed2:latest` 
- Reranking: `bge-m3:latest`

### 3. **Embedding Model Used for Text Generation**
**Problem**: The RAG Implementation agent was trying to use the embedding model (`snowflake-arctic-embed2:latest`) for text generation, but embedding models only support the `/api/embeddings` endpoint, not `/api/generate`.

**Error**: `"snowflake-arctic-embed2:latest" does not support generate`

**Solution**: Fixed the RAG agent in `src/local_crewai_workflow_for_synthetic_data_with_rag_and_llm_options/crew.py` to use the data generation LLM instead of the embedding LLM for text generation tasks.

### 4. **Model Detection and Testing**
**Problem**: The LLM manager needed to properly detect embedding models vs text generation models and test them using the correct endpoints.

**Solution**: The LLM manager already had proper logic to:
- Detect embedding models by checking model family (BERT, BGE, embed keywords)
- Use `/api/embeddings` endpoint for embedding models
- Use `/api/generate` endpoint for text generation models

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working Components:
- Dynamic model selection from available Ollama models
- Proper model testing (all models now pass tests)
- CrewAI crew initialization without OpenAI dependency
- Workflow manager now actually executes CrewAI tasks
- Fixed agent LLM assignments

### üîß Recent Fixes:
1. **Workflow Manager**: Now executes actual CrewAI workflow instead of simulation
2. **Test Configuration**: Dynamic model selection instead of hardcoded `llama2`
3. **RAG Agent**: Uses data generation LLM instead of embedding LLM
4. **LLM Manager**: Added `get_available_models()` method for compatibility

### üìä Test Results:
```
üß™ Testing Ollama Workflow Configuration
==================================================
üìã Configuration:
   Data Generation Model: ollama:mistral-small3.2:latest
   Embedding Model: ollama:snowflake-arctic-embed2:latest
   OpenAI API Key: ‚ùå Not provided (using Ollama)
   Ollama URL: http://host.docker.internal:11434

üîç Test 1: Testing LLM Manager
   data_generation: ‚úÖ PASS - Ollama model mistral-small3.2:latest is working correctly
   embedding: ‚úÖ PASS - Ollama embedding model snowflake-arctic-embed2:latest is working correctly
   reranking: ‚úÖ PASS - Ollama embedding model bge-m3:latest is working correctly   

üîç Test 2: Testing CrewAI Crew Initialization
   ‚úÖ Data generation LLM initialized successfully
   ‚úÖ Embedding LLM initialized successfully
   ‚úÖ CrewAI crew created without requiring OpenAI API key
```

### üöÄ Workflow Execution Progress:
The workflow now actually executes CrewAI tasks:
- ‚úÖ Document Processing Specialist - Completed
- ‚úÖ Model Selection Expert - Completed  
- ‚úÖ Synthetic Data Generation Specialist - Completed
- üîß RAG Implementation Specialist - Fixed (was failing due to wrong LLM assignment)

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Full Workflow**: Run the complete workflow through the frontend to verify all fixes work together
2. **Verify Results**: Check that actual synthetic data and RAG implementations are generated (not just metadata)
3. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure the workflow runs efficiently with your dual 4090 GPUs

## Files Modified

1. `backend/workflow_manager.py` - Added actual CrewAI execution
2. `test_ollama_workflow.py` - Dynamic model selection
3. `src/local_crewai_workflow_for_synthetic_data_with_rag_and_llm_options/crew.py` - Fixed RAG agent LLM assignment
4. `backend/llm_manager.py` - Added compatibility method
5. `test_crew_workflow.py` - New test file for CrewAI workflow verification

## Key Insights

- **Embedding models** (like `snowflake-arctic-embed2`, `bge-m3`) can only create embeddings, not generate text
- **Text generation models** (like `mistral-small3.2`) should be used for all agents that need to generate responses
- **Dynamic model selection** is crucial for flexibility across different Ollama installations
- **Actual workflow execution** vs simulation makes a significant difference in results
