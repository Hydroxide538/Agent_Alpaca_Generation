    "instruction": "*Final Answer:**\n\n\"How much of Earth's surface is covered by land if three-quarters is water?\"\n\nBut looking back at my deliberation, perhaps a better natural-sounding question without the \"if\" phrasing is:\n\n\"What fraction of Earth’s surface is land?\"\n\nBut to make it more directly tied to the given information while being natural, another option is:\n\n\"How much larger is the area covered by water compared to land on Earth?\"\n\nBut this requires calculating ratios (3:1), which is slightly more involved than necessary.\n\nAfter reconsidering, the simplest and most effective question that meets all criteria is likely:\n\n\"What fraction of Earth’s surface is land?\"\n\nBut to ensure it sounds natural in context, perhaps phrase it as a conversation starter:\n\n\"Approximately what portion of Earth's surface is land?\"\n\nThis avoids sounding like a direct math problem while still requiring use of the given fact.\n\nHowever, to align with typical oceanography-related questions and make it slightly more specific, another option is:\n\n\"How does the area covered by water compare numerically to that covered by land on Earth?\"\n\nBut this is verbose. The most concise natural question seems to be:\n\n\"What fraction of Earth’s surface is not covered by water?\"\n\nThis is equivalent to asking for land coverage (1/4) and uses the given fact directly.\n\nBut perhaps the most natural-sounding version without sounding like a textbook problem is:\n\n\"How much of Earth's surface is land?\"\n\nThus, the final question is:\n*What fraction of Earth’s surface is land?**\n\n\\boxed{What fraction of Earth’s surface is land?}",

    "output": "*Summary:**\nThe fraction of Earth’s surface covered by land is determined by subtracting the water-covered area from the total surface area. Given that three-quarters (3/4) of Earth's surface is water, the remaining one-quarter (1/4) must be land.\n\nMathematically:\n\\[ \\text{Land} = 1 - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\nTherefore, \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}}\\) of Earth’s surface is covered by land.\n\nThis answer directly uses the provided information and presents it in a clear, comprehensive manner."
