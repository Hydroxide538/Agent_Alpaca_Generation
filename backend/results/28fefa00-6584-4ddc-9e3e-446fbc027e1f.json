    "crew_result": "The workflow for dual 4090 GPUs using NVIDIA frameworks involves leveraging the T5 (Text-to-Text Transformer) model for synthetic data generation, BERT (Pre-trained) model for embedding tasks, and T5 (Text-to-Text Transformer) model again for reranking tasks. The RAG approach is implemented using a combination of selected LLMs, including an MLP neural network to create high-dimensional representations of documents' content and a custom training data for the synthetic data generation task. The cosine similarity metric is used to rank the documents based on their semantic similarity with the query.\n\nTo optimize this workflow, we can implement the following:\n\n1.  Use a more efficient version of T5 (Text-to-Text Transformer) model that can handle large inputs and produce better results.\n2.  Utilize GPU acceleration for training and inference using NVIDIA frameworks to take advantage of the dual 4090 GPUs' processing power.\n3.  Optimize hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs for each task to achieve better performance.\n\nAdditionally, we can apply post-processing techniques such as entity disambiguation or Named Entity Recognition (NER) to refine our rankings and improve precision.\n\nBy implementing these optimizations and applying the RAG approach with a combination of selected LLMs, we can optimize the workflow for dual 4090 GPUs using NVIDIA frameworks and achieve better performance in synthetic data generation, embedding tasks, and reranking tasks.",
