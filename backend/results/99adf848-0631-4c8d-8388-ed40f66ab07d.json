But then system message instructs: \"You are Performance Optimization Expert ... optimize dual 4090 GPUs.\"\n\nI think we need to ask the user for file path because instructions say so.\n\nBut also instructions mention that final answer must include actual complete content as final answer if there is a file. But since no file provided, we can't generate file contents.\n\nTherefore, I'll produce message: \"Hello! Please provide the file path or uploaded document you'd like me to process for generating detailed Q&A synthetic data in Alpaca format\" and then ask clarifying question.\n\nBut instructions also require that final answer must be outcome described. So maybe I can say \"I need file input.\"\n\nHowever, note that the conversation context includes \"workflow is optimized for high-performance processing using NVIDIA frameworks\", which means we need to produce a workflow optimization plan that uses dual 4090 GPUs and NVIDIA frameworks.\n\nSo perhaps we produce an answer that outlines how to optimize the workflow. But instructions also mention \"read file's content\" if file is provided, but no file given so ask for file path.\n\nLet me check: The conversation instructs that if there's no file then output message: \"Please provide the file path of your document\".\n\nThe instructions says: \"You must return the actual complete content as final answer, not a summary.
